# An Introduction Tutorial to Medical Imaging Segmentation with Deep Learning

It is not a mystery that medical images are a great tool in medicine. Besides being non-invasive, they are useful to diagnose, evaluate, and prevent diseases. Also, many physicians use medical images for research purposes. However, with the popularization of imaging methods, research centers are dealing with an increasing amount of data, that are costly to be manually analyzed. That`s when the medical imaging processing field is necessary. By using computational methods, engineers and computer science professionals can help physicians to diminish this bottleneck.
Over the years, more researchers are joining the medical imaging processing field, however many struggle with basic concepts in the beginning of their career. 

Here you find a a practical demonstration of basic principles described on our Tutorial Paper <link> according the workflow presented bellow:
